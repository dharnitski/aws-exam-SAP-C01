# Exam Terms

## Component

A component is the code, configuration and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement. A component is often the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other components.

## Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization focuses on avoiding un-needed costs. Key topics include understanding and controlling where money is being spent, selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types, analyzing spend over time, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

## Milestone

Milestones mark key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle (design, testing, go live, and in production).

## Operational Excellence

The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include managing and automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to successfully manage daily operations.

## Performance Efficiency

The performance efficiency pillar focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently. Key topics include selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve.

## Playbook

Playbooks are the predefined steps to perform to identify an issue. The results from any process step are used to determine the next steps to take until the issue is identified or escalated.

For example, you could define a playbook for network connectivity issues to an application. The initial step might be to determine if the client is able to resolve DNS for the site. The second step might be to determine if the client can reach the host of the site. If the client is able to reach the host, the next step might be to investigate the application web service. If the client is not able to reach the site, the next step might be to determine the path the client takes to the site. Each step should help isolate the source of the issue so that ultimately it can be identified and then addressed.

## Practices

Ways of doing things, process, standards, and accepted norms

## Principals

users, groups, services, and roles that take action in your account

## Reliability

The reliability pillar focuses on the ability to prevent, and quickly recover from failures to meet business and customer demand. Key topics include foundational elements around setup, cross project requirements, recovery planning, and how we handle change.

## Resiliency

The ability for a system to recover from a failure induced by load, attacks, and failures.

## Runbook

Runbooks are the predefined procedures to achieve a specific outcome. Runbooks should contain the minimum information necessary to successfully perform the procedure.

For example, the procedure to update static web site content might include staging the content in an uploaded content location, updating the web site to reference the new content, validating the display of the new content, and removing replaced content. The runbook might include steps to take if the new content does not display correctly. For example, roll back to prior content and notify the content team of the failure.

## Security

The security pillar focuses on protecting information & systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, identifying and managing who can do what with privilege management, protecting systems, and establishing controls to detect security events.

## Security of the cloud

AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud

## Security in the cloud

Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use

## Shared Responsibility Model

## Technology Portfolio

Within an organization the technology portfolio is the collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.

## Well-Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework includes strategies to help you compare your workload against our best practices, and obtain guidance to produce stable and efficient systems so you can focus on functional requirements.

## Workload

A workload identifies a set of components that deliver business value. The workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about. Examples of workloads include marketing websites, ecommerce websites, the backend for a mobile app, and analytic platforms.

# AWS Well-Architected Framework

## General Design Principles

* Stop guessing your capacity needs
* Test systems at production scale
* Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
* Allow for evolutionary architectures
* Drive architectures using data
* Improve through game days

## Pillars

* Operational Excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance Efficiency
* Cost Optimization

### Operational Excellence

The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

Design Principles

* Perform operations as code
* Annotate documentation
* Make frequent, small, reversible changes
* Refine operations procedures frequently
* Anticipate failure
* Learn from all operational failures

Best Practices

* Prepare
* Operate
* Evolve

### Security

The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

Design Principles

* Implement a strong identity foundation
* Enable traceability
* Apply security at all layers
* Automate security best practices
* Protect data in transit and at rest
* Keep people away from data
* Prepare for security events

Best Practices

* Identity and Access Management
* Detective Controls
* Infrastructure Protection
* Data Protection
* Incident Response

### Reliability

The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

Design Principles

* Test recovery procedures
* Automatically recover from failure
* Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
* Stop guessing capacity
* Manage change in automation

Best Practices

* Foundations
* Change Management
* Failure Management

### Performance Efficiency

The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve

Design Principles

* Democratize advanced technologies
* Go global in minutes
* Use serverless architectures
* Experiment more often
* Mechanical sympathy

Best Practices

* Selection
* Review
* Monitoring
* Tradeoffs

## Cost Optimization

The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

Design Principles

* Adopt a consumption model
* Measure overall efficiency
* Stop spending money on data center operations
* Analyze and attribute expenditure
* Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership

Best Practices

* Expenditure Awareness
* Cost-Effective Resources
* Matching supply and demand
* Optimizing Over Time
